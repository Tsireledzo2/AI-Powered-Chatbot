| Template Name         | Columns & Workflow            | Automation Features                  | Suitability for Agile Methodologies |
|----------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Basic Kanban**      | "To Do," "In Progress," "Done" | Manual issue movement               | Suitable for simple Agile tracking, lacks automation |
| **Automated Kanban**  | "To Do," "In Progress," "Done" | Auto-moves issues when PRs are linked or closed | Ideal for Agile sprints, reduces manual effort |
| **Team Planning**     | Customizable columns        | Auto-triages issues, priority sorting | Good for team backlog grooming and sprint planning |

### Justification  
For my project, **Automated Kanban** is the best choice because it supports **sprint tracking** with built-in automation, reducing manual effort. It ensures that issues automatically move based on pull requests, making it efficient for an Agile workflow.
