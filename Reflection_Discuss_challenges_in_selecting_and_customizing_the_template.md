# Reflection  

## Challenges in Template Selection & Customization  
- Choosing the **right template** was tricky since each had different features.  
- **Basic Kanban** lacked automation, making tracking harder.  
- **Automated Kanban** was great but needed tweaks for our workflow.  
- **Team Planning** was useful but had extra features we didnâ€™t need.  
- Customizing columns (e.g., **Blocked**, **Testing**) helped improve task tracking.  

## GitHub vs. Other Tools  
| Feature          | GitHub Kanban        | Trello            | Jira             |  
|----------------|--------------------|----------------|----------------|  
| **Templates**  | Basic, Automated, Team Planning | Simple Kanban | Scrum, Kanban, Agile Boards |  
| **Automation** | Auto-moves issues   | Power-ups needed | Advanced automation |  
| **Best For**   | Developers, GitHub teams | Simple task tracking | Large Agile teams, reports |  

**Conclusion**: GitHub is best for **developers**, Trello is simpler, and Jira is powerful but complex.
