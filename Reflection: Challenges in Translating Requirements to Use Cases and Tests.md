Developing use cases and test cases from system requirements is a critical but challenging task. Several challenges arise in this process:

### Ambiguity in Requirements

Requirements are often written in natural language, leading to ambiguities. This makes it difficult to create clear and testable use cases.

### Balancing Functional and Non-Functional Needs

Functional requirements, such as chatbot responses, must be clearly defined, but non-functional aspects like performance and security also need attention.

### Ensuring Completeness and Consistency

Use cases must cover all user interactions while ensuring no conflicts between different system functionalities.

### Handling Edge Cases

Defining test cases that address edge cases—such as unusual inputs or high user loads—is essential but often overlooked in initial requirement gathering.

### Aligning Stakeholder Expectations

Different stakeholders (developers, business owners, security engineers) may have conflicting needs, requiring compromises in functionality, usability, and security.
By addressing these challenges, the development process ensures a well-defined, testable, and robust chatbot system that aligns with business and user needs.
