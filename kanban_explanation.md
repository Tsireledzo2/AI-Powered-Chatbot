# Kanban Board Explanation  

A **Kanban board** is a tool that helps teams see their work and track progress.  

## ðŸ¤” How It Works  
- **Columns** show task stages (To Do â†’ In Progress â†’ Done).  
- **Work-in-Progress (WIP) limits** stop too many tasks from piling up.  
- **Agile support**: It helps teams work faster, adapt to changes, and deliver work continuously.  

Our board keeps tasks organized and avoids overload for better teamwork!
