# Challenges:

## Granularity: 
Finding the right level of detail too much detail made diagrams cluttered, too little lost clarity.

## Alignment with Agile: 
Mapping user stories to diagrams helped prioritize workflows but was time-consuming.

# Comparison:

## State Diagrams: 
Great for understanding how an object evolves (e.g., User, Intent).

## Activity Diagrams: 
Better for visualizing business processes or workflows (e.g., Generate Bot Response).

Both are essential: state diagrams show behavior of system parts, activity diagrams show how parts work together.
